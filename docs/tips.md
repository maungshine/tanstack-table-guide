# üí° Tips & Best Practices (React)

To get the most out of TanStack Table and build maintainable, efficient tables, keep these best practices in mind.

## 1. Keep Your Columns and Data Separate

Define your columns and data independently. This makes your table flexible and easier to maintain.

```tsx
const columns = React.useMemo(() => [...], []);
const data = React.useMemo(() => [...], []);
````

Using `useMemo` avoids unnecessary re-renders and performance issues.

## 2. Control State Externally When Needed

You can control sorting, filtering, pagination, and selection state outside the table component to sync with URL params or backend.

## 3. Use Headless Design to Your Advantage

TanStack Table is headless ‚Äî you build the UI yourself. Use this flexibility to integrate with your design system or UI framework.

## 4. Utilize Plugin System

Take advantage of built-in plugins like sorting, filtering, pagination, and row selection to extend functionality without reinventing the wheel.

## 5. Optimize Performance

* Use `useMemo` for columns and data.
* Use `getCoreRowModel` and other row model getters properly.
* Avoid heavy computations inside render methods.

## 6. Test Your Table Components

Since you control rendering, you can write unit tests and snapshot tests for your table UI easily.

## 7. Customize Cell Rendering

Use `cell.renderCell()` or your own custom cell renderers for complex cell content.

## 8. Accessibility Matters

Make sure to add proper roles, aria-attributes, and keyboard support to your tables.

## 9. Follow Semantic HTML Table Structure

Use `<table>`, `<thead>`, `<tbody>`, `<tr>`, `<th>`, and `<td>` properly for better accessibility and SEO.
